# handwritten-digit-classification
This project demonstrates the implementation of a Gaussian Naive Bayes approach for classifying handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The project evaluates the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, micro-average precision, recall, and F1 score. Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn were used for the implementation.
